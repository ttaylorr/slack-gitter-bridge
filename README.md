# slack-gitter-bridge

A bi-directional link between Slack and Gitter.

This program creates a transparent "link" between a Slack room and a Gitter room. Any messages sent to either will appear in both, automatically.

## Note

This project is currently a uni-directional link from Gitter into Slack. I am planning on using my own client implementation of the Slack API, which is lacking the RTM component, something I will add once I find the time.
